🎬 Movie App – React + TMDB API
This is a web application built with React that allows users to search for movies and manage a list of their favorites. 
The app fetches movie data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API, providing real-time search functionality and an intuitive user interface.


🚀 Features
Search Movies: Users can search for movies by title, with results dynamically fetched from the TMDB API.

Favorites List: Users can add or remove movies from their personal favorites list, which is managed locally within the app.

Routing: Navigation between pages (Home, Favorites, Search) is handled using React Router.

Global State Management: The app uses React Context API to manage the favorites list and share state across components.

React Hooks: Functional components make use of useState and useEffect to handle local state and side effects like API calls.
